This is a simple sample client of the Socialtext SOAP service,
version 0.9 using Apache Axis.

The client has been tested with:

  java version "1.5.0_06"
  Axis 1.4
  Xerces 2.8.0.

Edit build.xml to adjust the the following properties:

  axis.home:   The directory in which the axis lib dir
               (containing many jar files) is found.
  xerces.home: The directory in which the xerces jar files are found.
  wsdl:        The URL of the WSDL file for the SOAP service.
  workspace:   The name of the Socialtext workspace being addressed.
  username:    The username to authenticate as.
  password:    The password to authentictate with.
  page_name:   The name of the page to retrieve and edit.
  act_as_user: The name of the user to impersonate when accessing the
               workspace. For this to work, username above must be an
               admin in the workspace and the Admin Role in workspace
               must have the impersonate permission.

  stdout_encoding: See Encodings below.

Ant Targets:

  wsdl:      Call wsdl2java on the wsdl file
  compile:   Compile Main.java and the NLWSOAP/*.java files
  run:       Run the test client

  'ant run' will do all three.

  clean:     Delete all class files
  realclean: Run 'clean' and delete the wsdl2java generated files

Encodings:

  By default, the application will print its output on standard output using
  Java's 'default encoding' for your platform.  See
  http://www.jorendorff.com/articles/unicode/java.html for more details.

  Java often gets this wrong.  For example, regardless of locale
  settings on OS X, the default encoding is MacRoman.  If you set the
  property 'stdout_encoding' in build.xml to, e.g., UTF-8, this will be passed
  as a system property to the applications, strings will be thus encoded on
  stdout.
