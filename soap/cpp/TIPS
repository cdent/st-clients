Tips and/or state for the next poor hacker to use to try to figure this out.

What's broken:

- Accessing stuff via __ptr seems broken.
  - It is broken.  We encode stuff base64 because we're worried about wide
    characters.  Accessing __ptr works fine if our string was ASCII, but if
    not, then we're accessing binary data as if it were a 'char *'.

    Encoding our strings as base64 is the right SOAP thing to do on the server
    side.  On the client side, we can't really call our clients "finished"
    until we figure out how to decode and print the unicode characters to
    stdout.

    In fact, we should probably fetch that horrible Internationalization page
    as a test.

Debugging ideas:

- Uncomment '#define DEBUG' in stdsoap2.h to get debugging output in SENT.log,
  RECV.log, and TEST.log.
