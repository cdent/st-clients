First, create a self-signed, codesigning-enabled certificate (use password 1234 throughout)

openssl req -new -x509 -key key.pem -out selfsigned.pem -config ./openssl.cnf -extensions codesign
openssl pkcs12 -export -in selfsigned.pem -out selfsigned.p12 -name selfsigned -inkey key.pem

Then, use the adt tool to create the package

~/air/bin/adt -package -storetype pkcs12 -keystore selfsigned.p12 st-activity.air st-activity.xml css js st-activity.html

Then, you can use the Adobe Air Installation tool to run the air file, or you can put the air file up somewhere and have users click on it, after having installed the AIR runtime first.
