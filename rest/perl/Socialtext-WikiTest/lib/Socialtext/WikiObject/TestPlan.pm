=head1 NAME

Socialtext::WikiObject::TestPlan - Load wiki pages as Test plan objects

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.03';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use base 'Socialtext::WikiObject::TestPlan';
  my $test_plan = Socialtext::WikiObject::TestPlan->new(
      rester => $rester,
      page => $plan_page,
      server => $test_server,
      workspace => $test_workspace,
  );
  $test_plan->run_tests;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Socialtext::WikiObject::TestPlan fetches Wiki pages using the Socialtext 
REST API, and parses the page into a testplan object.  This class can be
subclassed to support different types of test plans.

Test Plans look for a list item at the top level of the page looking like 
this:

  * Fixture: Foo

This tells the TestPlan object to create a Socialtext::WikiFixture::Foo
object and use it to run the tests.  A default fixture can also be specified
in the constructor.

The wiki tests are specified as tables in the top level of the page.

Test Plans can also contain links to other test plans.  If no fixture is 
found, the test plan will look for wiki links in any top level list items:

  * [This Test Plan]
  * [That Test Plan]

These pages will be loaded as TestPlan objects, and their tests will be
run as well.
