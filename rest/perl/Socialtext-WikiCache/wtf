This module is a starting point to create a local cache of a workspace, perhaps supporting something like wikrad unplugged.


Future Ideas:
* sync to and from a workspace
* interactive conflict resolution - open $EDITOR with a 3-way merge
* batch conflict resolution - post the 3-way merge to the wiki
** Merge wafls? { theirs }, { yours } ???

* Is the wikicache also an implementation of our storage system?  Is this good or bad?
