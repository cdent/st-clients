Blikistan - Create a blog from content in a wiki

SYNOPSIS

  print CGI::header();
  my $b = Blikistan->new( rester => $r );
  $b->print_blog;

DESCRIPTION

Blikistan is a simple shiv that takes content and configuration
data from a Socialtext workspace, and generates a HTML blog
using a template.

Blikistan's unique design features a MagicEngine that can be 
written in any language.  The MagicEngine fetches the blog
config and blog posts using the Socialtext REST API.

Blikistan wants to ultimately have several different MagicEngines,
each in a different language so that blog authors have the choice
of which language their blog is powered by.

Blikistan is a blogging tool named after the small ex-Soviet country
Blikistan. Blikistan (the software) features a magic engine which pulls
all the blog configuration and postings from a Socialtext Wiki.
Blikistan (the country) has a population of 32,768 people, and the
population is fully literate. Blikistan's Government never meets in
person, all communication and planning is done on a wiki.  Blikistan
(the software) is the only blogging software that allows the blogger to
choose which language their blog will be powered by. The Magic Engine
can be implemented in any language using Perl's Inline modules. In
Blikistan (the country) taxes are filed online using SocialCalc.
Blikistan (both the country and software) is completely paperless.
