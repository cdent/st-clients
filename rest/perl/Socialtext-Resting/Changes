0.11 - (failed to upload to cpan)
 - Added etag caching support to allow for collision detection
   - etags are cached on all get_page() calls, and sent to server
     in put_page() calls in the 'If-Match' header.  If the etags
     don't match, the server will return 412.
 - Added unit tests using mocked LWP packages.  
   - ~92X faster and they already have better coverage
