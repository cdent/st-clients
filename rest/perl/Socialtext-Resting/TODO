* Write mocked test for create_user, no test currently because we don't want to
  create users (which can't be deleted) on prod every time the tests are run. 
* Write mocked test for add_user_to_workspace and get_users_for_workspace.
  These require an admin user to run, and rest-tester isn't one.

* add_pagetag should accept multiple tags, and use a json PUT
